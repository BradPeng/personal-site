# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, built using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The project leverages components from the [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) library for styling and UI design. 

The webpage is currently live at [https://bradpeng.ca/](https://bradpeng.ca/) and is hosted using GitHub Pages.

The site contains information about my past work experiences and my personal coding projects.
